## Objective
ExtraaLearn is a startup focused on providing programs in cutting-edge technologies to help students and professionals upskill or reskill. With a substantial number of leads generated regularly, ExtraaLearn faces the challenge of identifying which leads are most likely to convert. As a data scientist at ExtraaLearn, you are tasked with:

- Analyzing and building a machine learning model to identify leads with a higher likelihood of conversion.
- Discovering the factors that drive the lead conversion process.
- Creating profiles of leads that are likely to convert.
